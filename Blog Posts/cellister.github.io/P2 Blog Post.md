Learning new technical lingo

As if learning complex scientific terms wasn't enough, you now will dive into a new field and have to learn new vocabulary, programs and procedures. A professor once told me "You never really know; you just get used to seeing it." With physical typing and key stroke skills, that type of muscle memory development was helpful. For actual thinking and analyzing skills, I'd suggest a different approach.

Based on "Make it Stick" by Peter Brown, Henry Roediger, and Mark McDaniel, here are some tips to consider:

1. Self-Quizzing
We forget about 70% of what we hear and read, so frequent self-quizzing helps our brains create pathways to remember the information.

Pause during and after you read instructions, complete a lab, or watch an instructional video and ask yourself:
	-what is the purpose of the code (what does it do?)
	 -can I think of a situation or example of where using this method would be helpful?    
         (change the context)
 -Is there any part of this that I learned previously or does it look similar to something   
  that I�ve learned? (connect to prior learning)

2. Interleaving
This is the idea of practicing a few similar skills all at once.

Think of it this way, a data scientist who practices making 10 histograms, then 10 bar graphs, and then 10 scatter plots will perform better in practice than the data scientist who oscillates between the different coding needed to create the three graphs. It�s the data scientist who approaches graph making in a more random order and who develops the ability to decipher and choose the right graph for the data, and in the end, will become the stronger data scientist.

3. Spacing
Mass repetition relies on short-term memory. When a skill is practiced over time, long-term memory kicks in because information that has been partially forgotten is being accessed. If you are practicing a new method or skill this week and you only have two hours to practice, it would be best to break that up into one-hour chunks.

�The increased effort required to retrieve the learning after a little forgetting has the effect of retriggering consolidation (brain�s method of encoding information), further strengthening memory.

In summary, retrieving code patterns and strategy is hard, but the more effort you use to retrieve the information, the more likely that information will stick!

Some Learning Logistics

As a teacher, I've seen a lot of organization and learning strategies. Everyone learns differently, so don't be discouraged if something that works for someone else doesn't necessarily work for you. Here's my organization strategy that helps keep my learning flowing and my motivation going. 

First, realize that learning how to be functional in a coding language is deep cognitive work. Multitasking is my personal enemy. When I have too many different cognitive tasks, I end up getting very little done. I maximize time by eliminating transitioning and refocusing between cognitive tasks. 

For example, I purposely schedule one 'errand day' each week, where I will not be at a desk or doing much thinking work. On 'errand days,' I optimize my routes and complete as many errands as possible; whatever I can't finish waits until the next week. As a bonus, you can also use the travel time as creative time where you can record ideas or thoughts or as downtime where you call family members and friends to reconnect. 

I also schedule 'meeting days' (when I meet with teams and clients) and 'project days.' On 'project days,' I turn off my phone, don't check my email, and completely submerge myself into a thinking state where I create new value which otherwise would be hard to replicate. I schedule two days each week for these types of work. This is when I really focus on developing my technical skills.

Let's talk about "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. In his book he refers to what is called 'shallow work' (work that can be done in a semi-distracted state like errands, email, filing, etc).

"In an age of network tools, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business strategy or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality."

Newport suggests that shallow work is an indicator of less rare and valuable skillsets and that in the near future, this type of work will be replaced by cheaper alternatives like AI or by people willing to do the work for less money.

Deep work, on the other hand, is important intellectual work. Like I mentioned earlier, 'project days' are ideal for this kind of work. He gives three examples of successful people and their projects:

1. Mark Twain: worked in a cabin, isolated. His family had to blow a horn to alert him of meal times.
2. JK Rowling while writing the Harry Potter books posted this to Twitter: "This is the real me, but you won't be hearing from me often I am afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment."  
3. Bill Gates: conducted 'Think Weeks,' during which he isolated himself in a cottage to read and create. One think week led to the development of the Microsoft web browser.

Here's how I prepare myself and space for deep thinking work (technical skill building):

1. I find a dedicated space where I have everything that I need. For technical skill learning, I need:
a. Computer
b. Internet
c. Several sheets of blank paper
d. A pen
e. Post-it notes
f. Water
g. Tissues
h. A labeled folder where I will keep my notes

2. I show up for my project work on schedule. I like to start early (by 8:30am, if I can) because my brain is sharp in the morning, but this may be different for you. I keep my time window in mind from the beginning. Usually, my window is 8:30am-3pm; your time window may vary, and you may also choose to do a morning session, break, and afternoon session. You should arrange your time around a schedule that works best for you, but make sure to plan a designated window.

3. Make a project plan/routine. What lesson or lab are you trying to complete? Will you be reading, doing, or watching? What is your goal by the end of the day, and what is your plan for to accomplishing it. I spend the first 10 minutes of my 'project day' writing lists and goals, which I use to ease into getting started.

4. Remember to fuel your brain and body. I usually start my project time after I've had my coffee or tea, so my brain is powered on and ready to go. Keeping my brain hydrated with water is usually all that I need to make it through the day; if you need something else, you should have that ready to go before you start your project time; otherwise, those natural needs will become a distraction and take away from your deep work.

5. Plan ahead to avoid predictable distractions. Certain types of distractions can be anticipated and avoided with advance planning before beginning a project day. Some examples of these include arranging that night's dinner or arranging service/repair personnel to come on another day. Whenever possible, I try to satisfy these things before they become distractions on a project day. 

I've found these learning and scheduling routines to be helpful and productive and I hope that you find these tips useful! Happy learning!
