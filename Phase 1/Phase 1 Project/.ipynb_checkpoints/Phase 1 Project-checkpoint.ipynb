    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A company is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircrafts. I will be determining which aircrafts are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will translate my findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircrafts to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I will determine which aircrafts have the lowest risk for a company to begin a new business endeavor. To do this, I will start by investigating data on various makes and models of airplanes and their fatality counts to understand a percentage rate of plane model linked to fatality in plane crashes.\n",
    "Next, using that percentage rate and logistical regression models, I’ll explore relationships to plane damage and level of injury in plane investigations to describe a risk.\n",
    "I’ll seek to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1.\tWhich plane model has the lowest rate of fatality? (What plane is a safe choice to limit risk of fatality?) \n",
    "2.\tDuring investigation, which model was found to sustain the least amount of aircraft damage? (Which plane model is the most durable?)\n",
    "3.\tWhat level of injury was found in investigations relating to different plane models? (What plane is a safe choice to limit liability for bodily injuries?)\n",
    "4. FAA regulation liability? Safe Harbor?\n",
    "Finally, I will explore two particular aspects of safety:\n",
    "1.\tA rank of the number of accidents by month and weather.  Knowing which time of year are accidents more likely to happen as a result of weather, can advise the company on heavy or light scheduling of flights.\n",
    "2.\tA look at how the aircraft model correlates to place of accident or incident (broad phase of flight). This could advise which parts of the plane need to be meticulously monitored for performance before and during each flight to prevent investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for this project was obtained from the following repository and also saved in ZippedData folder in this repositpory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from Kaggle, Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be divided into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Data preparation\n",
    "    1. Importing libraries\n",
    "    2. Reading and cleaning provided data\n",
    "    3. Dealing with missing values\n",
    "    4. Joining datasets\n",
    "    5. Scraping additional data and cleaning it\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Visualizations and insights\n",
    "    1. Creating visualizations\n",
    "    2. Drawing conclusions\n",
    "    3. Providing recommendations\n",
    "\n",

The dependent variables that I think will best inform on safety are 'Fatality', 'Damage to Plane', and level of injury.
